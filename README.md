## invoice-service
I've made a few changes to the original assignment, so that clients can make more than one payment, clients can query their total debt,
also they are informed when they pay more than what they should.

## sos-game
I've also made simple changes to the original game, so that players can get more than one point in each move, the points the get are equal to the 
number of SOS matches in their single move. There can possibly be more than one match in each move since the computer has no intelligence
in its decision-making other than not placing its letter to a filled spot.
